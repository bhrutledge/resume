## Summary

I have been writing and using software to solve problems for over 12 years. I
enjoy studying software systems and explaining how they work.

I was an embedded software engineer for three years, then left the industry in
2005 to pursue people-oriented work. I was fortunate to find it at a large bike
shop, where I enjoyed the flow of a variety roles, from selling bikes to
administering software, all focused on connecting customers with cycling. In my
free time, I have expanded my software development skills by building
responsive websites back-to-front. In 2014, I made the switch to professional
web development, with a focus on exercising my skills with like-minded people
working to speed the adoption of renewable energy.
