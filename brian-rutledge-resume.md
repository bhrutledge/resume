## Summary

I enjoy learning software systems, using them to solve problems, and explaining
their concepts and usage. I'm looking for opportunities to do that with a team
of people working on solutions that will improve people's lives.

I was an embedded software engineer for three years, then left the industry in
2005 to pursue people-oriented work. I was fortunate to find it at a large bike
shop, where I've enjoyed the flow of a variety roles, from selling bikes to
administering software, all focused on connecting our customers with cycling.
In my free time, I have expanded my software development skills by building
responsive websites back-to-front.
