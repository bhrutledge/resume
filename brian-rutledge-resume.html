        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I have been writing and using software to solve problems for over 15 years. I was an embedded software engineer for three years, then left the industry in 2005 to pursue people-oriented work. I was fortunate to find it at a large bike shop, where I enjoyed the flow of a variety roles, from selling bikes to administering software. In 2014, I made the switch to professional web development, with a focus on exercising my skills with like-minded people working to speed the adoption of renewable energy. In my free time, I have expanded my software development skills by building responsive websites back-to-front. I enjoy studying software systems and explaining how they work.</p>
